				<h1>Hey, I am Kelly</h1>

				<strong>
				<p>Currently, I am Vice President of the student association in my
					major, Human Centered Design & Engineering for the 2023-2024 school
					year. The reason I joined HCDEsa is to connect with my peers and get
					more involved within my community for my final year at UW. My main
					responsibilities as VP include planning the social & professional
					development events throughout the school year alongside the president
					and filling in for the president when they are absent. I also support
					the other officers in their roles. Ultimately, I bring together the
					team by making sure that everyone is on the same page with our
					schedule/weekly meetings and initiating team bonding activities.</p>

				<p>In terms of my career goals, I am split between working as a UX
					designer and a developer.

					During my first three years of college as a nonmajor. I enrolled in
					various computer programming classes to broaden my knowledge and
					prepare for applying to any technology-related major. However, upon
					getting accepted into HCDE, I've been exposed to the social aspect
					of technology involving user research and design. Now I try to find
					ways to incorporate design into my work. I strive to create as well
					as innovate technology in a way that helps people in their daily
					lives.</p>

				<p>In my free time, I like to play ultimate frisbee, volleyball, or an
					outdoor activity. I enjoy watching K-dramas, listening to music, and
					eating food. </p>
