        <p>The purpose of LinkPals is to provide a platform for students to
					connect and find study groups. With the ongoing pandemic, students
					may feel disconnected from their peers and lack in-person
					interactions. LinkPals aims to bring students together and help them
					find peers to study with. This project was for HCDE 318, the
					User-Centered Design course.</p>

          <h2><strong>Role</strong></h2>
          <p>UX Designer</p>
          <p>UX Researcher</p>

          <h2><strong>Team</strong></h2>
          <p>Maia Song</p>

          <h2><strong>Timeline</strong></h2>

          <h2>Problem Space</h2>
          <p class="text">At times, it can be difficult for students to reach
            out to classmates outside of a school setting. Maintaining
            relationships with study members can be just as important as
            finding people to study with for many students.</p>

          <h2>Design Question</h2>
          <strong>How might we create an mobile application that facilitates
            students' academic success and community building?</strong>
        </section>


        <section class="two">
          <header class="heading">User Research</header><hr>
          <p>Our research consisted of two different components: semi-structured
            interviews and a competitive analysis.</p>


          <h2>Competitive Analysis</h2>
          <p>Along with our user research, we conducted a competitive analysis
            on a product/service related to our problem space. I analyzed
            <strong>Slack</strong> and my teammates explored <strong>Discord,
            Study Bunny: Focus Timer, and KiwiLink.</strong>
            Including analyzing the platform's functions, the goal of my
						competitive analysis was to identify and learn how the product
						satisfies as well as fails to meet the users' needs.</p>


          <h2>User Interviews</h2>
          <div class="analysis">
          <p>As a team, we conducted five user interviews with
            college students in various majors. We asked them about how they
            interacted with their classmates and how they formed study groups.
            Our research helped us get a grasp of our users and determine the
            problem space to begin designing.</p>

            <strong>Key insights from the interviews:</strong>
            <li>Students feel intimidated reaching out through their class platforms (Slack, Piazza, etc.)</li>
            <li>Students find it difficult to find study groups with classmates</li>
            <li>Student wants to meet up in study groups more often than they currently are.</li>


          </div><br>

          <h2>Personas</h2>
          <img class="persona" src="images/rebecca.jpg" alt="persona">
          <img class="persona" src="images/marty.jpg" alt="persona">

          <div class="analysis">
          <p>Our personas integrated our findings from our research and
            interviews to create a representation of our users. We created the
            persona to show the characteristics of our users and focus our
            design on those personas. The scenario in the persona describes a
            typical occurrence for our user and gives context for the user
            journey map.</p>

            <strong>Key insights:</strong>
            <li>Target audience - college students</li>
            <li>Exam-heavy fields of study need more study sessions</li>
            <li>Social interactions and connections are important for forming study groups</li>
            </div><br>

            <h2>User Journey Map</h2>
            <p>We decided to focus on one of our personas, who was Rebecca, a
              college undergraduate student. We created a user journey map that
              depicts her <strong>actions and emotions</strong> through a
              typical day at school. A majority of the journey map was made from
              our findings, but we made some assumptions about her thoughts and
              feelings.

              The user journey map highlighted moments of high stress/anxiety
              and happiness that we designed <strong>based on specific scenarios
              our persona encountered</strong>, which helped us construct an
              avenue for our persona to discover and evaluate our platform in
              solving her problem.<br>

          <h2>Design Requirements</h2>

          <strong>The design should...</strong>
            <li>Allow users to find other users compatible for studying</li>
            <li>Provide chatting and social interaction features for users</li>
            <li>Allow users to create and modify user profiles</li>
            <li>Provide a calendar feature (upcoming events) for users that signed up for study groups</li>
            <li>Facilitate online study sessions that can be joined anytime</li>

            <div class="goals">
              <h2>Design Goals</h2>
              <strong>The design aims to...</strong>

              <li>Foster growth and healthy relationships amongst study groups</li>

            <h2>Storyboarding</h2>
            <img class="persona" src="images/storyboard.png" alt="persona">

            <p>We created storyboards to visualize and highlight key events in
              the scenarios described in our design requirements and goals.

              The storyboards helped us discover possible design solutions
              within the context of our users' scenarios. This was one of the
              initial stages of planning our app layout and flow. The
              storyboards determined what key features would be relevant and
              necessary to include in the next step of our design process, the
              information architecture.</p>

            <h2>Information Architecture</h2>
            <img class="persona" src="images/infoarch.png" alt="persona">

            <p>We created an information architecture diagram to organize the
              hierarchy of the pages in our app. The diagram links the design
              solutions presented in the storyboards. This layout helped us
              organize how our app would flow from one page to another.</p>

          <strong>Connecting with a peer to study together</strong>
          <p>The user will click on a user profile card to get to a page where
            the user can click on a button that adds the person as a friend.
            Once they have added this person, they can connect with them through
            chat messages to get to know the person and set up study times.</p>

          <strong>Joining a live study session with other students</strong>
          <p>The user will navigate through the live sessions tab, looking at
            the various course streams. They will click on a course they are
            interested in watching. Once they are in the live session, they can
            chat with other students.</p>

            <header class="heading">Reflection</header><hr>
            <p>After working through the different steps of the design process,
              I learned more about our users and how to foster connections
              between students as well as effectively working in a team to
              deliver a product.</p>

            <div class="analysis">
              <strong>If we had more time, I would...</strong>
              <li>Conduct more interviews with a wider range of users (different universities)</li>
              <li>Extend our application to a wider range of students beyond college</li>
              <li>Additional usability testing of prototypes to understand which features user like or need to be changed</li>

              <strong>Main Takeaways</strong>
              <li>Each step of the design process is flexible and builds off one another</li>
              <li>This project strengthened my communication between users as well as my team members</li>
