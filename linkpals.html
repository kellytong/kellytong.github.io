				<!-- Overview -->
					<h2>Overview</h2><hr>
					<p>LinkPals is a conceptual mobile app designed to provide a platform for
						students to connect with others and find study groups. The goal is to make
						networking less awkward and more intentional by providing easy ways to
						discover students with similar academics and start meaningful conversations.</p>

					<div class="overview">
						<h2><strong>My Role</strong></h2>
						<p>UX Designer</p>
						<p>UX Researcher</p>

						<h2><strong>Team</strong></h2>
						<p>Maia Song</p>
						<p>Matthew Pedraja</p>
						<p>Ha Tien Nguyen</p>

						<h2><strong>Timeline</strong></h2>
						<p>Jan 2023 - Mar 2023</p>
						<p>(10 weeks)</p>
					</div><br>

					<h3>Problem Space</h3>
					<p class="text">Many people find networking events overwhelming and awkward,
						struggling to initiate conversations or find like-minded people in large
						crowds. There's a need for a tool that facilitates easy, relevant connections
						in real-time.</p>

					<h3>Design Question</h3>
					<strong>How might we create an mobile application that facilitates students' academic success and community building?</strong>
					<br><br><br>

				<!-- User Research -->
					<h2>User Research</h2><hr>
					<p>Our research consisted of two different components: semi-structured
						interviews and a competitive analysis.</p>

					<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
					<p>Along with our user research, we conducted a competitive analysis on a product/service related to our problem space. I analyzed
						<i>Slack</i> and my teammates explored <i>Discord, Study Bunny: Focus Timer, and KiwiLink.</i> Including analyzing the platform's
						functions, the goal of my competitive analysis was to identify and learn how the product satisfies as well as fails to meet the
						users' needs.</p>

					<h3>User Interviews</h3>
					<div class="analysis">
						<p>As a team, we conducted five user interviews with college students in various majors. We asked them about how they interacted with
							their classmates and how they formed study groups. Our research helped us get a grasp of our users and determine the problem space
							to begin designing.</p>

						<strong>Key insights from the interviews:</strong>
						<li>Students feel intimidated reaching out through their class platforms (Slack, Piazza, etc.)</li>
						<li>Students find it difficult to find study groups with classmates</li>
						<li>Student wants to meet up in study groups more often than they currently are.</li>
					</div><br>

					<h3>Personas</h3>
					<img class="persona" src="images/linkpals/rebecca.jpg" alt="persona">
					<img class="persona" src="images/linkpals/marty.jpg" alt="persona"><br><br>

					<div class="analysis">
						<p>Our personas integrated our findings from our research and interviews to create a representation of our users. We created the
							persona to show the characteristics of our users and focus our design on those personas. The scenario in the persona describes a
							typical occurrence for our user and gives context for the user journey map.</p>

							<strong>Key insights:</strong>
							<li>Target audience - college students</li>
							<li>Exam-heavy fields of study need more study sessions</li>
							<li>Social interactions and connections are important for forming study groups</li>
					</div><br>

					<h3>User Journey Map</h3>
					<p>We decided to focus on one of our personas, who was Rebecca, a college undergraduate student. We created a user journey map that
						depicts her <strong>actions and emotions</strong> through a typical day at school. A majority of the journey map was made from our
						findings, but we made some assumptions about her thoughts and feelings.

						The user journey map highlighted moments of high stress/anxiety and happiness that we designed <strong>based on specific scenarios
						our persona encountered</strong>, which helped us construct an avenue for our persona to discover and evaluate our platform in
						solving her problem.<br><br>

				<!-- Design -->
					<h2>Design<h2><hr>
					<h3>Design Requirements</h3>
					<strong>The design should...</strong>
					<li>Allow users to find other users compatible for studying</li>
					<li>Provide chatting and social interaction features for users</li>
					<li>Allow users to create and modify user profiles</li>
					<li>Provide a calendar feature (upcoming events) for users that signed up for study groups</li>
					<li>Facilitate online study sessions that can be joined anytime</li><br>

					<h3>Design Goals</h3>
					<strong>The design aims to...</strong>
					<li>Connect students amongst each other in coursework</li>
					<li>Foster growth and healthy relationships amongst study groups</li>
					<li>Facilitate userâ€™s academic and social success</li><br>

					<h3>Storyboarding</h3>
					<img class="persona" src="images/linkpals/storyboard.png" alt="persona">

					<p>We created storyboards to visualize and highlight key events in the scenarios described in our design requirements and goals.
						The storyboards helped us discover possible design solutions within the context of our users' scenarios. This was one of the initial stages
						of planning our app layout and flow. The storyboards determined what key features would be relevant and necessary to include in the next
						step of our design process, the information architecture.</p>

					<h3>Information Architecture</h3>
					<img class="persona" src="images/linkpals/infoarch.png" alt="persona">

					<p>We created an information architecture diagram to organize the hierarchy of the pages in our app. The diagram links the design solutions
					presented in the storyboards. This layout helped us organize how our app would flow from one page to another.</p>

				<!-- Protoype -->
					<h2>Prototype</h2><hr>
					<h3>Main Tasks</h3>

					<img class="mockup" src="images/linkpals/home.png" alt="">
					<img class="mockup" src="images/linkpals/messages.png" alt=""><br>

					<div class="task">
						<strong>Connecting with a peer to study together</strong>
						<p>The user will click on a user profile card to get to a page where the user can click on a button that adds the person as a friend.
						Once they have added this person, they can connect with them through chat messages to get to know the person and set up study times.</p>
					</div><br>

					<img class="mockup" src="images/linkpals/live.png" alt="">
					<img class="mockup" src="images/linkpals/session.png" alt=""><br>

					<strong>Joining a live study session with other students</strong>
					<p>The user will navigate through the live sessions tab, looking at the various course streams. They will click on a course they are interested
						in watching. Once they are in the live session, they can chat with other students.</p>

						Link to the full interactive Figma prototype</a><br><br>

					<h2>Reflection</h2><hr>
					<p>After working through the different steps of the design process, I learned more about our users and how to foster connections between
						students as well as effectively working in a team to deliver a product.</p>

					<div class="analysis">
						<strong>If we had more time, I would...</strong>
							<li>Conduct more interviews with a wider range of users (different universities)</li>
							<li>Extend our application to a wider range of students beyond college</li>
							<li>Additional usability testing of prototypes to understand which features user like or need to be changed</li>

						<strong>Main Takeaways</strong>
							<li>Each step of the design process is flexible and builds off one another</li>
							<li>This project strengthened my communication between users as well as my team members</li>
