			<h1>Brand Book - Redesign</h1><hr>

			<ul class="actions">
				<li><a href="index.html" class="button">Back to Portfolio</a></li>
			</ul>

				<p>My goal in the redesign was to space out the information on the
				website and find a color scheme that is complementary to the nature of
				the organization. During the process of creating this brand book, I
				utilized the white space to separate the paragraphs and expand the
				images.</p>

					Cover, client research, logo redesign, color scheme, typography &
					visual elements, imagery, mobile flow & description</p>

				<p>Here is a quick run-through of the brank book I created on Figma.
					The rest that follows goes in more depth about my thought processes
					and description for each of the brand book components.</p><br>

					<section class="one">
		        <header class="heading">The Client</header><hr>
		        <p><strong>The Mountaineers'</strong> mission is to help people in
							the community get outdoors and expand their knowledge about nature
							in the Pacific Northwest.</p>

						<p>Adults ranging from ages 20 to 50 who are looking to participate
							in outdoor activities are their <strong>primary audience</strong>.
							Their secondary audience is youth or seniors outside of the age
							range.</p>

						<p>In the current Mountaineers visual brand, a <strong>strength</strong>
							is the type hierarchy which makes the headings easily readable and
							allows for navigation to different sections of the website.
							However, a <strong>weakness</strong> of their current brand is the
							saturation of the colors on the website. The bright orange and
							neon green feel too bright and don't complement each other. Also,
							the spacing between the text is very small, making the page feel
							overwhelming with the amount of information. There is white space
							on the margins of the page that could be used to spread the
							amount of text and make images larger.</p>

						<p>The keywords that describe how the organization brand should feel
							are <strong>nature, mountains, welcoming/inclusive, lively, and
								community.</strong></p>
						</section>


						<section class="two">
			        <header class="heading">Logo</header><hr>
							<p>For the logo redesign, I wanted to make the organization's name
								more prominent. It was designed to convey a feeling of
								challenging the outdoors and the courage to engage in activities
								in nature. Currently, the logo is small mountains with a
								capital M. My logo design expands the mountain range and fits
								the organization's name underneath.</p>

						</section>

						<section class="three">
			        <header class="heading">Color Palette</header><hr>
							<div class="palette">

							<p>The Mountaineers is a nature-based organization. As I mentioned
								previously, the current website uses bright colors that do not
								complement each other well. In addition, most of the images
								highlight various shades of green to represent the outdoors.</p>

								<p>Thus to avoid having green in the color palette, I chose a
								complementary color scheme of dark blue and beige (sand). The
								bright orange is for a pop of color to the color scheme and
								indicates buttons.</p>

								<img id="palette" src="images/color scheme.jpg" alt="">
								</div>
						</section><br>

						<section class="four">
			        <header class="heading">Typography & Visual Elements</header><hr>
							<p>For the typography, I chose the Roboto Slab Regular font. The
								Serif typeface makes it semi-formal but still friendly. The
								table shows the various sizes used in the redesign. The visual
								elements listed show what I included in the mobile flow.</p>

								<li>The blue banners are for the headings and borders</li>
								<li>The image blur is for the image carosel on the home page</li>
								<li>The buttons are common signifiers for actions people
									normally are familiar with:</li>
									<div class="bullet">
										<li>Hamburger menu</li>
										<li>Profile icon</li>
										<li>"X" to close</li>
										<li>"+" to expand for more information</li>
									</div>

						</section>

						<section class="five">
			        <header class="heading">Imagery</header><hr>
							<p>The imagery emphasizes nature as well as the social aspect of
							connecting with the community. It depicts nature itself or
							individuals/groups of people involved in an outdoor activity. The
							images advocate for The Mountaineers' mission of helping people
							engage in outdoor activities and build a community in the PNW.</p>

						<section class="six">
			        <header class="heading">Mobile Flow</header><hr>
							<p>Task - sign up for a course on The Mountaineers website</p>
							<iframe style="border: 1px solid rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.figma.com/embed?embed_host=share&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.figma.com%2Fproto%2FiV8YDRzLABC4h1ra8PATBz%2FAssignment-8%253A-High-Fidelity-Mobile-Interface%3Ftype%3Ddesign%26node-id%3D1-398%26t%3DSWprJSGaO3Qa7ZrF-1%26scaling%3Dscale-down%26page-id%3D0%253A1%26starting-point-node-id%3D1%253A398%26mode%3Ddesign" allowfullscreen></iframe>
							<p>The first pain point was that the current homepage felt
								text-heavy and had multiple tabs or buttons leading to the same
								page. To make the homepage less overwhelming and redundant, I
								removed most of the text and replaced the buttons with image
								sliders to give people visuals of the outdoor activities.</p>

							<p>The second pain point was that courses requiring prerequisite
								courses did not link the user to that prerequisite course.
								Thus the user would have to search for the prerequisite course
								themselves. So I included a link to the prerequisite course to
								simplify their search process.</p>

							<p>The third pain point was that the signup page for the
								course was too text-heavy with the apply button at the bottom
								after much scrolling. Instead, I condensed all the information
								into a box with a plus button to indicate the user to click on
								it for more information.</p>
