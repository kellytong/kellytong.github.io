							<p>In the 2023-2024 school year, I was Vice President of the student association in my major,
								Human Centered Design & Engineering for. The reason I joined HCDEsa is to connect with my peers
								and get more involved within my community for my final year at UW. My main responsibilities as
								VP include planning the social & professional development events throughout the school year
								alongside the president and filling in for the president when they are absent. I also support
								the other officers in their roles. Ultimately, I bring together the team by making sure that
								everyone is on the same page with our schedule/weekly meetings and organizing team bonding activities.</p>

							<p>In terms of my career goals, I enjoy working as a UX designer and a
								developer. Upon getting accepted into HCDE, I was introduced to the
								social aspect of technology involving user research and design. Now I
								try to find ways to incorporate design into my work. I strive to create
								as well as innovate technology in a way that helps people in their daily
								lives.</p>

							<p>In my free time, I like to play ultimate frisbee and volleyball or
								engage in an outdoor activity. I enjoy watching K-dramas, listening to
								music, and eating food.</p>
