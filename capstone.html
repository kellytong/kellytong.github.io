				<!-- Overview -->
					<h2>Overview</h2><hr>
					<p>In our capstone project, we worked with the City of Bellevue to help them evaluate the accessibility of their current park
             signage and identify effective ways to improve signage accessibility. Through this research, our team delivered a final
             research report of our findings across four milestones and a recommended design system for the city’s park signage that
             includes accessibility guidelines. The issue of accessibility in signage is most important for safety. Signs provide navigation
             so that visitors don’t become lost and provide emergency hotlines or procedures. Beyond that, signage accessibility is
             important for inclusivity and user experience. Having accessible signage allows more people to visit and interact with parks
             and trails as well as promotes community bonding.</p>

					<p>The City of Bellevue's mission is to foster a welcoming community through parks, natural spaces, recreational activities, arts
						and culture, and provide community services. They strive for Bellevue residents to connect with one another and experience nature
						to help people thrive. Currently, the City of Bellevue is searching for ways to enhance people's park experiences through signage.​</p>

          <h3>Problem Space</h3>
					<p class="text">Our team focused on two locations in Bellevue: <u>Crossroads Park</u> and <u>Mercer Slough Nature Park</u></p>

					<h3>Design Question</h3>
					<strong>How might we improve the accessibility of signage for the City of Bellevue?</strong>
					<br><br>

          <h3>Research Questions</h3>
					<li>How do our users understand what features to visit in a park and the different ways of getting from point A to point B?</li>
					<li>What gaps or barriers in signage and wayfinding keep people from fully enjoying our parks and trails?</li>
					<br><br>

        <!-- Milestone 1 -->
          <h2>Milestone 1 - Information Gathering</h2><hr>
          <p>In our first milestone we researched information on park signage and also conducted field observations to build a foundation
						for moving forward in the user reseach and design phase. This process consisted of studying literature regarding general
						signage design standards and accessibility policies. When considering how to approach the signage redesign process, ensuring that
						language access and ADA standards are considered throughout the entire process is crucial.</p>

          <h3>Field Observations</h3>
          <p>To further our research, we conducted field observations at two Bellevue Parks: Crossroads Park and Mercer Slough Nature Park.
						During the field observation, the research team recorded their observations based on five different categories: people, environment,
						weather, accessibility, and signage. The main objective is to gain a better understanding of the current interactions with signage
						and the types of activity happening at the park. We analyzed our findings through thematic analysis with sticky notes to pull
					 	themes and issues observed (images of analysis below).</p>

					<p>Overall Crossroads Park provides abundant informational signs for visitors. This includes the park guideline rules, leash & scoop
						signs for dog owners, and navigation wooden posts to direct people to different areas of the park. The primary concern with the Crossroads
						Park signage is that there are little to no interactions with the current signs. These signs are text-heavy and have no structure to
						organize the information.</p>

					<p>Overall Mercer Slough Nature trails lack caution, location indications, and navigation signs. However, the reason behind this is for
						people to immerse themselves in nature and explore. The main signage issue is that the wooden bollards, functioning as trail markers
						providing directionality and distance, were hard to understand; the directions appeared contradictory because directions were provided
						on multiple sides of the bollards. Additionally, the wooden bollards lack identifying numbers and emergency contact information.
						Furthermore, there are areas where the trails were either steep, muddy, or a combination of both. Given these observations were done the
						day after it rained with the lack of warning/caution signage.</p>

					</div><br>

					<p><strong>Field observations insights:</strong><p>
					<li>The park rules guidleines are text-heavy with no text hierarchy to structure and organize the information</li>
					<li>The symbology is unclear</li>
					<li>Many park visitors do not obey the dog leash/scoop signs</li>
					<li>Trail wayfinding signage lack caution and emergency information</li><br>

				<!-- Milestone 2 -->
        	<h2>Milestone 2 - User Research</h2><hr>
          <p>Our user research consisted of semi-structured interviews with park rangers and park visitors. The goal of this stage is to understand two
						different spaces: (1) the intentions, experiences, and common issues experienced by Parks & Recreation staff and (2) the behaviors, needs,
						and accessibility concerns faced by park visitors as they interpret signage. The interviews will help give a more informed understanding
						of the current state of signage in Bellevue parks and point us toward possible design recommendations for the design phase afterward.</p>

					<p>The set of questions we asked the park visitors prompted them to think about their experiences at the park as well as their interactions
					  with the signs. For the interviews with park staff, we inquired about their interactions with park visitors as well as the challenges they
						face while working.</p>

					<p>For analysis, we listened to the audio recording and looked at the transcript to highlight important statements interviewees mentioned.
					  Overall, there is little interaction with the signs and most of them are ignored.</p>

					<p><strong>Main takeaways from the interviews:</strong></p>
					<li>Improved signage information (text hierarchy, color contrast, clear symbology)</li>
					<li>Identifying motivation for following park rules</li>
					<li>Inclusion of visual map on park trails</li><br>

					<p>Final report for milestone 2 that compiles our interviews and findings:<p>

				<!-- Milestone 3 -->
					<h2>Milestone 3 - Design</h2><hr>

					<p>In this redesign stage, we compiled our findings from milestone 1 and two to begin designing the initial prototypes of the park signage. We decided
					  to focus on three different signs (from left to right): (1) park rules guideline, (2) pet leash/scoop sign, and (3) park trail wayfinding signs.
					  These three signs were selected to address the issues revealed in the research and interview phase.</p>

					<div class="images">
						<img class="signage" src="images/capstone/guideline.png" alt=""/>
						<img class="signage" src="images/capstone/leash.png" alt=""/>
						<img class="signage" src="images/capstone/wayfinding.png" alt=""/>
					</div><br>

					<p>For all of the Bellevue park signage, we changed the teal color to be consistent with Bellevue's current color scheme which is a darker blue. The
						higher color contrast between the sign and the text color makes it easier to read. The font on the redesigns was updated to Montserrat to match Bellevue Parks's brand.</p>

					<div class="images"><img class="signage" src="images/capstone/guideline redesign.png" alt=""/></div>

					<p>For the park guideline rules sign, we condensed the amount of text. In our user research, we discovered that many people would not read the signs
						because of the abundant information included. Thus we highlighted the important rules at the top. Furthermore, to reduce the amount of text, we
						represented the rules through icons enclosed in the not allowed red symbols with captions below.</p><br>

				 <div class="images"><img class="signage" src="images/capstone/leash redesign.png" alt=""/></div>

				 <p>The pet leash and scoop sign is the rule that is most commonly not obeyed by park visitors. To attempt to address this issue, we included a monetary fine
				  for visitors to encourage them to leash and scoop after their pets.</p><br>

					<div class="images">
						<img class="signage" src="images/capstone/wayfinding redesign.png" alt=""/>
						<img class="signage" src="images/capstone/wayfinding map redesign.png" alt=""/>
					</div><br>

					<p>Wayfinding signs are a crucial feature at Bellevue Park trails. Currently, the pathway directions are inaccurate in pointing out ways people can walk.
					The problem lies in the structure of the wooden bollards. The arrows are placed on the sides of the wooden post and at some forks in the paths, the arrows
					could mislead park visitors. In our redesign, we would have a taller wooden post with directional arrows pointing down the path instead of being attached
					to one side of the wooden post. Furthermore, we included a visual map on this wayfinding sign to allow visitors to see the overall view of the trail and
					their current location.</p>

					<h3>Redesign Evaluation</h3>
					<p>To evaluate our initial signage redesigns, we conducted A/B testing through surveys. There are four comparison sections in the survey. In each section,
						we included the current sign side-by-side with our redesigned signs. The survey questions asked people to choose the signs they liked. Subsequently, we
						asked them to explain their choice. We also provided a free response for each comparison set to enable respondents to input other feedback on the designs.</p>

					<p>The first two sets	evaluate the same park guideline rules sign but with different variations. The first set includes the rules and symbology with captions
						all in one sign. The second set splits the guideline sign into two signs: one with the rules and the other sign is strictly symbology with no captions below them.
						The reasoning behind this design is to evaluate if the symbology alone is sufficient for people to understand the rules.</p>

					<p>The third comparison set evaluates the pet leash and scoop sign. The main difference between our design and the original signage is that we included a consequence
						(monetary fine for not leashing and scooping) to encourage park visitors to follow the rules.  </p>

					<p>Finally, for the fourth comparison set, we compared the wooden bollard signs at the trails. Currently, the wooden posts have no visual representation of the trails.
						The directional arrows don’t accurately point in the direction of the destination. For our redesign, we included flag signs at the top that point in the direction of
						destinations. Furthermore, we added a visual map with a location indicator to provide visitors with a sense of their current location on the trail. The map is also
						color-coded to match the flag signs to make it easier for visitors to figure out where they are going. </p>

					<p><strong>A/B Testing Survey Results</strong></p>
					<li>Not all symbology used is universal</li>
					<li>Missing prohibited acts</li>
					<li>Red prohibiiton signs covers the icons</li>
					<li>Avoid punitive language</li>
					<li>Height of wayfinding sign is too tall, visibility issues</li>
					<li>Lack emergency information</li><br>

				<!-- Milestone 4 -->
					<h2>Milestone 4 - Final Deliverables</h2><hr>

					<p>In the final milestone of our capstone project, we compiled each component to present at our UW capstone presentation and to the Bellevue sponsors. First, the
					design system is a more visual form of our work and suggestions for the park signage. The final research report is a written document of all our research, suggestions,
					and sources. Finally, the video is a short podcast we created to quickly demonstrate our problem space, project objectives, and recommendations for reimagining and
					redesigning the signs at Bellevue Parks.</p>

					<p><strong>Design System</strong></p>
					<p>The design system we created is intended for the City of Bellevue to reference as they update their park signage. To summarize, this booklet integrates our research
					and evaluation of the accessibility of Bellevue's current park signage. We included suggestions for the color scheme, symbology, and final redesigns of the signs from milestone 3.</p>

				<!-- Reflection -->
					<h2>Reflection</h2><hr>

					<p>Reflecting on the process of redesigning park signage for the City of Bellevue, I realized the intricate balance between user needs and the constraints of the public
						sector. Our project enabled us to engage with nature, and it felt like our work would be incorporated into future improvements of Bellevue parks. Whereas regular
						course projects and assignments would be evaluated by the teaching team, it was meaningful to me that sponsors, as well as Bellevue residents, gave their input about
						our work because the diverse perspectives motivated me. When I see that the people involved are passionate about what they do, it inspires me to do what I can to assist
						them. Part of this makes me feel like I am contributing to my community, and the small moments of appreciation drive me to act.</p>

					<p>While our focus initially honed in on accessibility, particularly for individuals with disabilities and non-native English speakers, the scope broadened to encompass
						the broader demographic of Bellevue Park visitors due to time constraints. In hindsight, incorporating the perspectives of individuals with disabilities and non-English
						speakers would have enriched our design process and contributed to more inclusive and accessible signage solutions. Given the opportunity to revisit the project with
						ample time, I would apply the concept of codesigning. This could involve multiple interviews/discussions with this target group rather than a one-time interview. Such
						workshops would help me understand their viewpoints and enable me to ask them directly how I can support them and ensure their input is incorporated throughout the design process.</p>

					<p>Ultimately, my experience of designing park signage for the City of Bellevue simulated the complex nature of UX design in real-world contexts. It taught me how to manage
						tight deadlines, foster effective communication across diverse teams, and seek assistance when needed. Throughout the project, I learned to balance user needs, stakeholder
						input, and organizational constraints, which not only enhances accessibility but also contributes to the overall user experience and enjoyment of public spaces. Despite
						my lack of interest in the public sector, this project provided a refreshing departure from the typical web and mobile design focus on technology. Designing signage amidst
						nature and within the community felt deeply meaningful, as it allowed me to witness the tangible impact of my work on the world around me. Overall, the capstone project
						was an excellent opportunity to apply UX design practices beyond the school curriculum and design in the physical environment. After graduating and eventually beginning
						my career, I will leverage the knowledge and insights gained from this experience to effectively engage with future colleagues, clients, and various stakeholders.</p>
